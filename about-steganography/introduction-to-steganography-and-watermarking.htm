								Introduction</b></font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								<br>
								The earliest recordings of Steganography were by 
								the Greek historian Herodotus in his chronicles 
								known as &quot;Histories&quot; and date back to around 440 
								BC. Herodotus recorded two stories of 
								Steganographic techniques during this time in 
								Greece. The first stated that King Darius of 
								Susa shaved the head of one of his prisoners and 
								wrote a secret message on his scalp. When the 
								prisoner’s hair grew back, he was sent to the 
								Kings son in law Aristogoras in Miletus 
								undetected. The second story also came from 
								Herodotus, which claims that a soldier named 
								Demeratus needed to send a message to Sparta 
								that Xerxes intended to invade Greece. Back 
								then, the writing medium was text written on 
								wax-covered tablets. Demeratus removed the wax 
								from the tablet, wrote the secret message on the 
								underlying wood, recovered the tablet with wax 
								to make it appear as a blank tablet and finally 
								sent the document without being detected.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Romans used invisible inks, which were based on 
								natural substances such as fruit juices and 
								milk. This was accomplished by heating the 
								hidden text, thus revealing its contents. 
								Invisible inks have become much more advanced 
								and are still in limited use today.
								During the 15th and 16th centuries, many writers 
								wrote on Steganographic techniques such as 
								coding techniques for text, invisible inks, and 
								incorporating hidden messages in music.</font></p>
								<p align="left">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054">
								<b>Steganography:</b></font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Steganography or Stego as it is often referred 
								to in the IT community, literally means, 
								&quot;Covered writing&quot; which is derived from the 
								Greek language. Steganography is also defined as 
								follows, &quot;Steganography is the art and science 
								of communicating in a way which hides the 
								existence of the communication. In contrast to 
								Cryptography, where the enemy is allowed to 
								detect, intercept and modify messages without 
								being able to violate certain security premises 
								guaranteed by a cryptosystem, the goal of 
								Steganography is to hide messages inside other 
								harmless messages in a way that does not allow 
								any enemy to even detect that there is a second 
								message present&quot;.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">In a digital world, Steganography and 
								Cryptography are both intended to protect 
								information from unwanted parties. Both 
								Steganography and Cryptography are excellent 
								means by which to accomplish this but neither 
								technology alone is perfect and both can be 
								broken. It is for this reason that most experts 
								would suggest using both to add multiple layers 
								of security.<br>
								Steganography can be used in a large amount of 
								data formats in the digital world of today. The 
								most popular data formats used are .bmp, .doc, 
								.gif, .jpeg, .mp3, .txt and .wav. Mainly because 
								of their popularity on the Internet and the ease 
								of use of the steganographic tools that use 
								these data formats. These formats are also 
								popular because of the relative ease by which 
								redundant or noisy data can be removed from them 
								and replaced with a hidden message. Steganographic technologies are a very important 
								part of the future of Internet security and 
								privacy on open systems such as the Internet. 
								Steganographic research is primarily driven by 
								the lack of strength in the cryptographic 
								systems on their own and the desire to have 
								complete secrecy in an open-systems environment.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Many governments have created laws that either 
								limit the strength of cryptosystems or prohibit 
								them completely. This has been done primarily 
								for fear by law enforcement not to be able to 
								gain intelligence by wiretaps, etc. This 
								unfortunately leaves the majority of the 
								Internet community either with relatively weak 
								and a lot of the times breakable encryption 
								algorithms or none at all. Civil liberties 
								advocates fight this with the argument that 
								“these limitations are an assault on privacy”. 
								This is where Steganography comes in. 
								Steganography can be used to hide important data 
								inside another file so that only the parties 
								intended to get the message even knows a secret 
								message exists. To add multiple layers of 
								security and to help subside the &quot;crypto versus 
								law&quot; problems previously mentioned, it is a good 
								practice to use Cryptography and Steganography 
								together. As mentioned earlier, neither 
								Cryptography nor Steganography are considered 
								&quot;turnkey solutions&quot; to open systems privacy, but 
								using both technologies together can provide a 
								very acceptable amount of privacy for anyone 
								connecting to and communicating over these 
								system.</font></p>

								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054"><b>Watermarking:</b></font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Watermarking can be described as a method for 
								embedding information into another signal. In 
								case of digital images, the embedded information 
								can be either visible or hidden from the user.
								Typical usage scenarios for watermarking are 
								copyright protection and data authentication. 
								The distinction between steganography and 
								watermarking is not always clear. Basically, in 
								case of watermarking the additional information 
								is used to protect the original image (in case 
								of copyright management), whereas in the 
								Steganography the image is used to protect the 
								additional information (secret messages). By 
								definition, the visible watermarks are not 
								included in Steganography.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">During the past ten years, digital watermarking 
								has attracted the attention of numerous 
								researchers. As a result, hundreds of studies 
								have been published concerning the different 
								methods for watermarking. The information 
								embedded as a watermark can be almost anything. 
								It can be a bit string representing copyright 
								message, serial number, plain text, etc. 
								However, sometimes it can be more useful to 
								embed a visual watermark (corporate logo) 
								instead of a bit string as a watermark.
								One of the first techniques for watermarking is 
								the least-significant bit modification. It is 
								based on the substitution of LSB plane of the 
								cover image with the given watermark.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">It is desirable that the watermark can not be 
								removed from the cover image. However, several 
								intentional and unintentional operations with 
								the watermarked image may provide possibility 
								for disabling the watermark. Commonly, these 
								operations (especially the intentional ones) are 
								referred as attacks against watermarks.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">An interesting application for digital 
								watermarking is image authentication. With the 
								help of advanced image editing software, digital 
								images can be manipulated maliciously. In image 
								authentication, a specific watermark is inserted 
								into image, so that all attempts to manipulate 
								the content of the image will alter the 
								watermark also.</font></p><hr>
