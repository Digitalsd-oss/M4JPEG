M4JPEG project aims to build a Matlab-compiled steganography tool working in the field of JPEG images. The provided M4JPEG tool lets the user hide a private file within a JPEG image using an adaptive steganographic method called Mod4[1].

NOTES ABOUT USE:
----------------

1- The StartGUI files (.m, .fig) are the starting ones. StartGUI.m represents the main GUI that calls all other GUIs and required functions.

2- The pre-compiled MEX files (.mexwXX) perform the lossless compression steps including the entropy coding and decoding. The zip file of jpeg_toolbox contains pre-Matlab-compiled MEX files according to 
several systems.
