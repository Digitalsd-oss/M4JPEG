M4JPEG project aims to build a Matlab-compiled steganography tool working in the field of JPEG images. The provided M4JPEG tool lets the user hide a private file within a JPEG image using an adaptive steganographic method called Mod4.
The current version of M4JPEG doesn’t include an encryption layer, thus the file we want to hide is not encrypted before the embedding process. But, the hiding layer is protected by using a key-based permutation generator.
